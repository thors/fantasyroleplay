\section{Character Generation}
\subsection{Basics: Species and Archetype}
Creating a new charakter requires several decisions. The most fundamental decisions are which archetype and which species the new charakter should resemble. Depending on these decisions, some boundaries are already defined for possible body strength, intelligence, fear, aggression etc.

A new character has two main properties, the species and the archetype. For each species there are typical limitations. For example, for an adult human a size between 150cm and 200cm should be expected; the possible range might allow for a bit 100cm to 240cm to match the extremes, but e.g. 300cm or 20cm are unrealistic. For each archetype there are some multipliers for some of the properties, e.g. the charisma of a wizzard is typically higher than that of a soldier, while the soldier probably has a higher body strength.

Each character starts with ``average'' values and some bonus points, which can be spent on modifications. You can choose to reduce the intelligence in order to gain additional bonus point, or spend bonus points on higher body strength.
